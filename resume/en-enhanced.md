### Highlights {#highlight}


Scalable Sharding Framework
:  
  __Kuaishou__
  Kuaishou provide a live streaming platform which was supporting over 400k broadcasting rooms concurrently.  
  Each broadcasting room has its business data or flows to process, such as watching lists, online count, or some boring games base on live streaming.  
  We designed a framework based on ZooKeeper and gRPC, the core concept of this framework is from MapReduce. When we need to process some new feature of each broadcasting room, we can simply use this framework to implement our business logic, and this framework will automatically scale up or down according to the number of process nodes.

Live Red Envelope 
:  
  __Kuaishou__
  In China, Red Envelope is a common way to attract people to increase user engagement. We can meet many Red Envelopes in the same application, but there are some differences and also some similarities between them.   
  According to the common usages, we designed a framework based on gRPC and MySQL, aiming to reduce the duplicate developing work in most Red Envelope use cases. The core idea is similar to a distributed transaction method called SAGA.    
  The framework provides four core functions, create and deposit, divide and transfer, covering the whole lifecycle of Red Envelope. When we are building a new Red Envelope use case, all we need to do is just register in the framework and implement some required currency management methods.  

Live Signaling Frameworks
:  
  __Kuaishou__
  According to the protocol and broadcasting model of the live streaming long-connection server, we built several frameworks which totally decouple it from businesses.  
  These frameworks support different styles of business by different parts, including ActionSignal, StateSignal, GlobalBroadcastSignal, etc.  
  All of them are widely used and obviously improve the development efficiency.

Karthas
:  
  __Kuaishou__
  As a part-time developer joined the infra team and build a JVM tool independently called Karthas which is based on Arthas.  
  Based on Arthas, Karthas support more effective function to use, such as web-console, initial-script, and the killer feature called MVEL.
  Relying on MVEL, we can call any method of our application conveniently. I made this feature open-sourced in [arthas-mvel](https://github.com/XhinLiang/arthas-mvel)
