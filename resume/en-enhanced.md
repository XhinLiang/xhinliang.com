### Highlight {#highlight}


Tracing & Logging Optimization
:  
  __Shopee__
  Designed and built the tracing flow from frontend to all of the backend mirco-services, which support sample tracing, whitelist tracing.
  Extended the existing RPC framework to pass-throgh trace-id and several common fields automaticly;  
  Remastered the clients of databases and caches to support span reporting;  
  Wrote lots of backend components like rate-logging, custom rpc header, error-reporting, etc.

Sharding Framework
:  
  __Kuaishou__
  Kuaishou provide a live-streaming platform which support over 400k broadcasting rooms concurrently.  
  Each broadcasting room has its business data or flows to process, such as watching-lists, online count, or some interactive games based on live-streaming.  
  We designed a framework using ZooKeeper and gRPC, the core concept of this framework just like MapReduce.  
  This framework help us apply any business logics to each broadcasting room, and scale up or down automatically according to the number of process nodes.

Signaling Framework
:  
  __Kuaishou__
  According to the protocol and broadcasting model of the live-streaming long-connection server, we built several frameworks which totally decouple it from business.  
  Signaling framework support different styles of business by using different strategies, including time-series, state-sync, global-notify, etc.  
  All of them are widely used and obviously improve the development efficiency.

Karthas
:  
  __Kuaishou__
  As a part-time developer I joined the infra team and built a JVM tool independently called Karthas which is based on Arthas.  
  Based on Arthas, Karthas support more effective functions to use, such as web-console, initial-script, and the killer feature called MVEL.
  Relying on MVEL, we can call any method of our application conveniently. Open-sourced version in [arthas-mvel](https://github.com/XhinLiang/arthas-mvel).
