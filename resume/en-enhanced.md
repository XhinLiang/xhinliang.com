### Highlights {#highlight}


Tracing & Logging Optimization
:  
  __Shopee__
  Designed and built the tracing flow from the frontend to all of the backend micro-services, which support sample tracing, and whitelist tracing.  
  Extended the existing RPC framework to pass-through trace-id and several common fields automatically;  
  Remastered the clients of databases and caches to support span reporting;  
  Wrote lots of backend components like rate-logging, custom RPC header, error reporting, etc.

Sharding Framework
:  
  __Kuaishou__
  Kuaishou provides a live-streaming platform that supports over 400k broadcasting rooms concurrently;  
  Each broadcasting room has its business data or flows to processes, such as watching user lists, online counts, or some interactive games based on live-streaming;  
  We designed a framework using ZooKeeper and gRPC, the core concept of this framework is just like MapReduce;  
  This framework helps us apply any business logic to each broadcasting room, and scale up or down automatically according to the number of process nodes.

Signaling Framework
:  
  __Kuaishou__
  According to the protocol and broadcasting model of the live-streaming long-connection server, we built several frameworks which totally decouple it from the business.  
  The signaling framework supports different styles of business by using different strategies, including time-series, state-sync, global-notify, etc.  
  All of them are widely used and obviously improve development efficiency.

Karthas
:  
  __Kuaishou__
  As a part-time developer, I joined the infra team and built a JVM tool independently called Karthas which is based on Arthas;  
  Based on Arthas, Karthas support more effective functions to use, such as web-console, initial-script, and the killer feature called MVEL;
  Relying on MVEL, we can call any method of our application conveniently. Open-sourced version in [arthas-mvel](https://github.com/XhinLiang/arthas-mvel).
